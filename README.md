- 👋 Hi, I’m @Austin-T-Jones
- 👀 I’m interested in game development/design
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java, C, C#, software engineering
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on learning and improving my coding skills and produce fun yet challenging games
- 📫 austinjones@mail.adelphi.edu
- I would love to not only improve my own skills but helps others and my goal is to ultimately just make games that a lot of people can enjoy.
  If anyone else shares this passion I would love to hear from you, hear your experience and advice, and any challenges you may have encountered!
